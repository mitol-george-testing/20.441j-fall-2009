description: Lecture notes on cell-surface interactions, biological specificity and
  cooperativity, adsorption of ligands on most biomaterials surfaces as a random process,
  non-interacting sites, adsorption on interacting sites, cooperative processes, the
  unit cell process, a model of a critical transition from noncooperative to cooperative
  cell behavior, and use of matrix algebra to decompose Z.
